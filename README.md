  madlibs.py is a madlib program based on the popular phrasal template word game.
  NOTE: random_madlibs.py and sample_madlibs are madlibs that I created for variety. Running the random_madlibs.py will randomly generate and run a random madlib
  
  number_guess.py (deals with imports) is a function in which the user is prompted to guess a number with a particular range. Then the program will print feedback either guess was too low or too high. The program also has the reverse were the program guesses a number that the user has. User input provides feedback for the program.
