# My-coding-journey
A couple of beginner projects here, listed from easiest to hardest.

madlibs.py: madlibs! (practice with inputs, strings)

  NOTE: random_madlibs.py and sample_madlibs are madlibs that I created for extra practice and for editing. 
  
guess_number is a two part game where the user and program take turns guessing a random number.

rock_paper_scissors.py: rock paper scissors (practice with functions and if statements)
