# My-coding-journey
Documenting my journey in learning to code. 
Projects are listed here from easiest to hardest. 

  *madlibs.py is a madlib program based on the popular phrasal template word game. It consists of prompts for the user to enter of words to substitute for blanks 
in a story that will print once all of the prompts have been entered. 
  *NOTE: random_madlibs.py and sample_madlibs are madlibs that I created for variety. Running the random_madlibs.py will randomly generate and run a random madlib
