# My-coding-journey
Documenting my journey in learning to code. 
Projects are listed here from easiest to hardest. 

  madlibs.py is a madlib program based on the popular phrasal template word game.
  NOTE: random_madlibs.py and sample_madlibs are madlibs that I created for variety. Running the random_madlibs.py will randomly generate and run a random madlib
  
  selector.py: simply a random selector to tell me who to facetime! (deals with imports)
