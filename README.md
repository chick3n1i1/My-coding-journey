# My-coding-journey
A couple of beginner projects here, listed from easiest to hardest.

madlibs.py: madlibs! (practice with inputs, strings)

  NOTE: random_madlibs.py and sample_madlibs are madlibs that I created for extra practice and for editing. 
  
guess_number is a two part game where the user and program take turns guessing a random number.

rock_paper_scissors.py: rock paper scissors (practice with functions and if statements)

hangman.py: classic word guessing game that allows players to take turns guessing letters to spell the word. Imported a word bank of +2,000 words

slotmachine.py: complex game that takes a deposit input from the user and keeps track of that balance (adding winnings and subtracting losses) this will allow the user to place bets up to 3 lines. 
  NOTE: the odds are adjustable and easily configurable based on the desire of the program.
